** DONE load stuff surrounding current viewport
** DONE make better wireworld rep server-side
** DONE use setview
[[file:~/src/wire-universe/assets/main.js::// TODO send constantly send SetView. Also extract conversion to tiles into function]]
** DONE make brush change trigger redrawing brush at mouse position
[[file:~/src/wire-universe/assets/main.js::document.onkeydown = (event) => {]]
** TODO place palette on top of canvas?
** TODO send refresh when a client sends a setview in case the refresh rate is low
** TODO optimize moving around/scrolling canvas
Take the already drawn thing and move it around instead of redrawing a ton of stuff. it gets pretty gnarly when you are trying to redraw a 1000x1000 canvas pixel by pixel at 160fps
** KILL refactor more stuff into modules
** DONE zoom in on mouse pointer instead of center
** KILL make more client variables u32 instead of i32
Too much work, not necessarily even useful
** TODO figure out why the cursor square outline is bigger than the cursor square
is browser specific? seems to only act like that on firefox, on chrome the outline seems wider at least
** TODO add world simulation on client side so we only have to send the border + changes
This may be not that important, and increases complexity a fair deal
* Unimportant
** TODO Setup size optimization for js
