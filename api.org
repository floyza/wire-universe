#+title: Api

Websockets api

OUT OF DATE! The basic schema here is correct, but see [[file:common/src/proto.rs]] for the actual api. Also, we don't use json anymore anyways, but if we did this is what it would look like.

* From Server
** Refresh
=x= and =y= should be the same as last received =x= and =y= from ~set-view~, and =tiles.length= should be equal to =h=, and =tiles[0].length= equal to =w=.
#+begin_src js
{
  "Refresh": {
    "x": 1,
    "y": 1,
    "tiles": [["Alive", "Wire", "Wire"],
              ["Empty", "Empty", "Empty"],
              ["Empty", "Empty", "Empty"]],
  }
}
#+end_src
* From Client
** ModifyCell
#+begin_src js
{
  "ModifyCell": {
    "x": 5,
    "y": 6,
    "cell": "Dead",
  }
}
#+end_src
** SetView
#+begin_src js
{
  "SetView": {
    "x": 2,
    "y": 2,
    "h": 100,
    "w": 100,
  }
}
#+end_src
